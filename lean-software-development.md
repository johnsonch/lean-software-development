#Standup

* A short daily meeting 
* Focus on the stories
	* Who is working on it with you?
	* What did you work on yesterday
	* What are you working on today?
	* Is there anything blocking you?

<!-- Presenter Notes -->
^ 
* This gives visibility into what is causing a story to not be delivered
* Do not judge
* There is no reason to not ask for help

  * What can we do better?
* Look at your process
  * Is it helping us deliver while meeting our goals?
  * Do we need to change anything?

#Code Retros

* Take time to retrospect on your code base
	* Are we incurring technical debt?
	* Are we being consistent?
	* Are we coding ourselves into a corner?
